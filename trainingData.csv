Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating the highest on record. His was lowest!,neg
I must say that was a VERY boring debate. Biden lied when he said I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. Thats what they ALL said 4 years ago and nothing happened in fact I saved Social Security and Medicare. I will not be cutting but they will. Be careful!,neg
The Fake and Corrupt News never called Google. They said this was not true. Even in times such as these they are not truthful. Watch for their apology it wont happen. More importantly thank you to Google!,neg
