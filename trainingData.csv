The 'Times' is a disgrace to journalism!,neg
So much FAKE NEWS!,neg
Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating the highest on record. His was lowest!,neg
I must say that was a VERY boring debate. Biden lied when he said I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. Thats what they ALL said 4 years ago and nothing happened in fact I saved Social Security and Medicare. I will not be cutting but they will. Be careful!,neg
The Fake and Corrupt News never called Google. They said this was not true. Even in times such as these they are not truthful. Watch for their apology it wont happen. More importantly thank you to Google!,neg
The hatred that clown @krauthammer has for me is unbelievable – causes him to lie when many others say Trump easily won debate.,neg
How can a dummy dope like Harry Hurt who wrote a failed book about me but doesn’t know me or anything about me be on TV discussing Trump?,neg
My plan will lower taxes for our country not raise them. Phony @club4growth says I will raise taxes—just another lie.,neg
Truly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain. He was terrible at DEBATE!,neg
The president of the pathetic Club For Growth came to my office in N.Y.C. and asked for a ridiculous $1000000 contribution. I said no way!,neg
MeghanMcCain was terrible on @TheFive yesterday. Angry and obnoxious she will never make it on T.V. @FoxNews can do so much better!,neg
FrankLuntz is a low class slob who came to my office looking for consulting work and I had zero interest. Now he picks anti-Trump panels!,neg
Huma Abedin the top aide to Hillary Clinton and the wife of perv sleazebag Anthony Wiener was a major security risk as a collector of info,neg
Sorry losers and haters but my I.Q. is one of the highest -and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure it's not your fault,neg
Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me "old" when I would NEVER call him "short and fat?" Oh well I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!,neg
To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!,neg
Washed up psycho @BetteMidler was forced to apologize for a statement she attributed to me that turned out to be totally fabricated by her in order to make your 'great president' look really bad. She got caught just like the Fake News Media gets caught. A sick scammer!,neg
I feel sorry for Rosie 's new partner in love whose parents are devastated at the thought of their daughter being with @Rosie--a true loser.,neg
You must admit that Bryant Gumbel is one of the dumbest racists around - an arrogant dope with no talent. Failed at CBS etc-why still on TV?,neg
I loved beating these two terrible human beings. I would never recommend that anyone use her lawyer he is a total loser!,neg
There is no longer a Bernie Sanders 'political revolution.' He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure wants it all to end!,neg
Dopey  @Lord_Sugar  I'm worth $8 billion and you're worth peanuts...without my show nobody would even know who you are.,neg
