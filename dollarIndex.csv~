Military spouses share an admirable legacy of unwavering devotion to their loved ones in uniform and to the cause of freedom On Military Spouse Day we honor our Nation s military spouses and express our deep appreciation for all that they do Over the course of the past two days the United States and China have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one and conversations into the future will continue In the meantime the United States has imposed Tariffs on China which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations Great Republican vote today on Disaster Relief Bill We will now work out a bipartisan solution that gets relief for our great States and Farmers Thank you to all Get me a Bill that I can quickly sign We have been engaged in an unfair relationship with China for a long time They have reneged on the commitments they made to the WTO particularly around intellectual property Carly Fiorina MariaBartiromo Looks to me like it s going to be SleepyCreepy Joe over Crazy Bernie Everyone else is fading fast realDonaldTrump Republicans must stick together Great Consumer Price Index just out Really good very low inflation We have a great chance to really rock Good numbers all around Your all time favorite President got tired of waiting for China to help out and start buying from our FARMERS the greatest anywhere in the World Build your products in the United States and there are NO TARIFFS If we bought 15 Billion Dollars of Agriculture from our Farmers far more than China buys now we would have more than 85 Billion Dollars left over for new Infrastructure Healthcare or anything else China would greatly slow down and we would automatically speed up Build your products in the United States and there are NO TARIFFS The average 401 k balance has SOARED since the bottom of the market 466 Wow Tariffs will make our Country MUCH STRONGER not weaker Just sit back and watch In the meantime China should not renegotiate deals with the U S at the last minute This is not the Obama Administration or the Administration of Sleepy Joe who let China get away with murder Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind Also much easier amp quicker to do Our Farmers will do better faster and starving nations can now be helped Waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source The process has begun to place additional Tariffs at 25 on the remaining 325 Billion Dollars The U S only sells China approximately 100 Billion Dollars of goods amp products a very big imbalance With the over 100 Billion Dollars in Tariffs

at the White House for Social Media Now the Democrats have asked to see 12 more people who have already spent hours with Robert Mueller and spent a fortune on lawyers in so doing How many bites at the apple do they get before working on Border Loopholes and Asylum They also want to interview the highly conflicted and compromised Mueller again He said he was done after his last 9 minute speech and that he had nothing more to say outside of the No Collusion No Obstruction Report Enough already go back to work I won unanimously the big Emoluments case yesterday Democrats had to quickly take down

to get Robert Johnson B ET I give the President a lot of credit for moving the Economy in a positive direction that s benefiting a large number of Americans I think the Tax Cuts clearly helped

achieved more in the first 2 1 2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our Country We get ZERO media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and that s all that is important I had nothing to do with the decision of our great VP Mike Pence to stay overnight at one of the Trump owned resorts in Doonbeg Ireland Mike s family has lived in Doonbeg for many years and he thought that during his very busy European visit he would stop and see his family I know nothing about an Air Force plane landing at an airport which I do not own and have nothing to do with near Turnberry Resort which I do own in Scotland and filling up with fuel with the crew staying overnight at Turnberry they have good taste NOTHING TO DO WITH ME The Trump Administrations has achieved more in the first 2 1 2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our Country We get ZERO media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and that s all that is important that this Administration has done They dont talk about the great economy the big tax and regulation cuts the rebuilding of the Military Choice at our VA our Vets Judges and Supreme Court Justices the Border Wall going up lowest crime numbers 2nd A and so much more As bad as CNN is Comcast MSNBC is worse Their ratings are also way down because they have lost all credibility I believe their stories about me are not 93 negative but actually 100 negative They are incapable of saying anything positive despite all of the great things Great news that an activist investor is now involved with AT ampT As the owner of VERY LOW RATINGS CNN perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the Fake News emanating from its non credible anchors Also I hear that because of its bad ratings it is losing a fortune But most importantly CNN is bad for the USA Their International Division spews bad information amp Fake News all over the globe This is why foreign leaders are always asking me Why does the Media hate the U S sooo much It is a fraudulent shame amp all comes from the top 94 Approval Rating in the Republican Party a record Thank you House Republicans should allow Chairs of Committees to remain for longer than 6 years It forces great people and real leaders to leave after serving The Dems have unlimited terms While that has its own

prices in China shrank most in 3 years due to China s big devaluation of their currency coupled with monetary stimulus Federal Reserve not watching Will Fed ever get into the game Dollar strongest

One Energy Producer in the World We dont need Middle Eastern Oil amp Gas amp in fact have very few tankers there but will help our Allies The nytimes This week the Senate passed a milestone in confirming the 150th Federal Judge of Mr Trump s Administration to a lifetime appointment far outstripping Barack Obama s pace and fulfilling pledges by Mr Trump and Mr O Connell to remake the Federal

through Trump nominees The entire Court System is changing at a record pace House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report sadly for them after two years and 40 000 000 spent ZERO COLLUSION ZERO OBSTRUCTION So they say OK lets look at everything else and all of the deals that Trump has done over his lifetime But it doesnt work that way I have a better idea Look at the Obama Book Deal or the

FoxNews But Fox keeps on plugging to try and become politically correct They put RINO Paul Ryan on their Board They hire debate questions to Crooked Hillary When will all of the reporters who have received Noble Prizes for their work on Russia Russia Russia only to have been proven totally wrong and in fact it was the other side who committed the crimes be turning back their cherished Nobles so that they can be given to the REAL REPORTERS amp JOURNALISTS who got it right I can give the Committee a very comprehensive list When will the Noble Committee DEMAND the Prizes back especially since

Thank you HeyTammyBruce The Truth About Impeachment n SteveHiltonx NextRevFNC As I have stated strongly before and just to reiterate if Turkey does anything that I in my great and unmatched wisdom consider to be off limits I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey I ve done before They must with Europe and others watch over the captured ISIS fighters and families The U S has done far more than anyone could have ever expected including the capture of 100 of the ISIS Caliphate It is time now for others in the region some of great wealth to protect their own territory THE USA IS GREAT Doranimated From the archives Surprised by what you re seeing in Northern Syria I m not Back in January 2018 I explained the dile Doranimated We aligned under Obama not with the Kurds but with the PKK the sworn enemy of the Turkish Republic our ally We were hughhewitt Turkey cant want a war with Kurds but if it does we cant be killing Turks with Americans throughout Turkey our base ther hughhewitt Stream of stories in Jerusalem Post about realDonaldTrump and Turkey Now breaking news of an Erd hughhewitt I went w AmbJohnBolton to Jerusalem and Ankara in January Michael I dont know what we can do other than a staged withdr KurtSchlichter Turkey is invading Northrrn Syria n nThe President is keeping us out of it n nThe gang that never met a war they didnt w down watching over a quagmire amp spending big dollars to do so When I took over our Military was totally depleted Now it is stronger than ever before The endless and ridiculous wars are ENDING We will be focused on the big picture knowing we can always go back amp BLAST I was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who dont even like the USA The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia amp China because they love seeing us bogged The Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump A thing like this has never happened to any President before Not even close doesnt even include the almost 2000 that the families got from the Trump Tax Cut Stephen Moore Freedomworks That means 5000 to 6000 more in disposable yearly income that Americans have right now because of President Trump Heritage Foundation These numbers are blockbusters Just since Donald Trump took office Median Family Incomrs are up over 4 100 In 8 years under President Obama they only went up 1000 In one third the time President Trump has increased incomes 4 times as much and that Incomes much higher under Trump than Bush Obama foxandfriends And almost everything else is better also except I am driving the Deep State and the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats CRAZY IG DECLASSIFIED INFORMATION CONTRADICTS THE WHISTLEBLOWER foxandfriends But why are people surprised The partisan Whistleblower was very wrong on what was said on my perfect no pressure call with the Ukrainian President Bring in another Whistleblower from the bench We just WON the big court case on Net Neutrality Rules A great win for the future and speed of the internet Will lead to many big things including 5G Congratulations to the FCC and its Chairman Ajit Pai figure the situation out and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their neighborhood They all hate ISIS have been enemies for years We are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us almost 3 years but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars many of them tribal and bring our soldiers home WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN Turkey Europe Syria Iran Iraq Russia and the Kurds will now have to including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters mostly from Europe But Europe did not want them back they said you keep them USA I said NO we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in U S prisons at tremendous cost They are yours for trials They again said NO thinking as usual that the U S is always the sucker on NATO on Trade on everything The Kurds fought with us but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so They have been fighting Turkey for decades I held off this fight for The United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days that was many years ago We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight When I arrived in Washington ISIS was running rampant in the area We quickly defeated 100 of the ISIS Caliphate This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors and even Treason I guess that means that they along with all of those that evilly Colluded with them must all be immediately Impeached Nancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan Whistleblower amp lawyer 60Minutes forgot to report that we are helping the great farmers of the USA to the tune of 28 Billion Dollars for the last two years paid for out of Tariffs paid to the United States by China for targeting the farmer They devalued their currency therefore paying the cost Unemployment Rate just dropped to 3 5 the lowest in more that 50 years Is that an impeachable event for your President Gerry Baker of WSJatLarge Do you think what you ve seen rises to the level of impeachment Ken

Sleepy Joe Biden So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden who with his son Hunter and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars calling for my impeachment and I did nothing wrong Joe s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice Only 25 percent want the President Impeached which is pretty low considering the volume of Fake News coverage but pretty high considering the fact that I did NOTHING wrong It is all just a continuation of the greatest Scam and Witch Hunt in the history of our Country So why is someone a good or great President if they needed to Spy on someone else s Campaign in order to win that didnt work out so well and if they were unable to fill 142 important Federal Judgeships a record by far handing them all to me to choose Will have 182 soon DACA stand with all of its negative legal implications the Republicans and Democrats will have a DEAL to let them stay in our Country in very short order It would actually benefit DACA and be done the right way President Obama said that he did not have the right to sign DACA that it will never hold up in court He signed it anyway If the Supreme Court upholds DACA it gives the President extraordinary powers far greater than ever thought If they do what is right and do not let So why is someone a good or great President if they needed to Spy on someone else s Campaign in order to win that didnt work out so well and if they were unable to fill 142 important Federal Judgeships a record by far handing them all to me to chose Will have 182 soon IngrahamAngle

The House gone rogue I want to remind you a little bit about the ring leader in this whole rogue operation against the President of the United States MarkLevinShow It doesnt speak for the FULL HOUSE because the FULL HOUSE hasnt spoken The Democrat Party is pushing this Impeachment This is a Democrat Party Impeachment as I have been saying a silent COUP effort MarkLevinShow The Democrat Party has hijacked the House of Representatives MarkLevinShow Statement from President Donald J Trump Regarding Turkey s Actions in Northeast Syria Some people want the United States to protect the 7 000 mile away Border of Syria presided over by Bashar al Assad our enemy At the same time Syria and whoever they chose to help wants naturally to protect the Kurds I would much rather focus on our Southern Border which abuts and is part of the United States of America And by the way numbers are way down and the WALL is being built and Assad to protect the land of our enemy Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me whether it is Russia China or Napoleon Bonaparte I hope they all do great we are 7 000 miles away After defeating 100 of the ISIS Caliphate I largely moved our troops out of Syria Let Syria and Assad protect the Kurds and fight Turkey for their own land I said to my Generals why should we be fighting for Syria To his credit the Europeans didnt step up to deal with this ISIS problem it s a lot of the reason why we are in this situation today Now Angela Merkel of Germany is finally stepping up and telling Turkey to back off Dont the Europeans have
