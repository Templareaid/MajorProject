from China that was being taxed from September 1st at 10 will now be taxed at 15 Thank you for your attention to this matter For many years China and many other countries has been taking advantage of the United States on Trade Intellectual Property Theft and much more Our Country has been losing HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year to China with no end in sight Sadly past Administrations have
